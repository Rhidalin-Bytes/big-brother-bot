<!-- *** assist bonus settings ***
	Call of Duty passes damage amount info to the logs. Therefore we can award assists based on damage.
	So in the CoD series we award an assist if the amount of damage is 50 points or more and they must occur
	within 10 seconds before the victim dies. In other games we shorten the timespan because we don't have
	the amount of damage available, we have to award all assists, even the very tiny ones. The shorter time
	compensates for that.
