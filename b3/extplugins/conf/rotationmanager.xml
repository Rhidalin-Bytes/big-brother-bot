    Do you want the server to react fast to your playercount or would you like to
    reduce the number of rotationswitches? The hysteresis will make your switchcounts
    somewhat flexible. Setting it to 0 will make the plugin react at once when a 
    switchpoint is passed.

    Do you want the plugin to build a random rotation when switching? This is good when
    we need to switch a lot! I suggest you leave this set to true. (Options: true/false)

    The next line makes the new rotation effective immediately (next map).

    I think its fair if we wait for the slower maploaders. This option will fast_restart
    the next map after the set delay (seconds) so slower players have equal chances.
    Setting it to 0 will disable the function.

  Next section is the setting of maprotations. You can supply several maps for several gametypes
  Don't use a gametype twice in the same rotation though, it will not work as planned!
  You can however use a map more than once in a gametype if you would like to play it more often.
  If you left randomizerotation to true the plugin will create a random rotation from all gametypes/maps
  provided and it will be a proper and smart maprotation! Don't overdo it on the number of maps,
  it could lead to errors because the maprotation becomes too big for CoD! Use the syntax below!
